            <h3>Products & Services</h3>
            <p>For many years, operators of Airbus helicopters have been working behind the scenes to play their
                part, sometimes in ways that pass unnoticed to the untrained eye. That may mean servicing the
                alternative energy industry, redressing the wrongs done to natural habitats, enabling cleaner
                construction, deterring poachers, or simply conducting research.</p>

            <h3>Sustainability</h3>
            <p>The agricultural market is increasingly challenging due to the ongoing needs for more sustainable farming
                practices and higher production volumes. The complex requirement to optimise yields while improving
                harvest quality and reducing fertiliser use to protect the environment is creating great demand for
                satellite imagery of agriculture and precision farming services. </p>
